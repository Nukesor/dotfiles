# Dotfiles

Hey!

This is a collection of my personal configuration files for my environments.

The dotfiles are managed with [toml-bombadil](https://github.com/oknozor/toml-bombadil) ([docs](https://oknozor.github.io/toml-bombadil/)).

## i3 Layout

Use `i3-save-tree --workspace $NUMBER > /tmp/layout.json` to create a layout for a specific workspace.
See the [official docs](https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html) for more info.
